# API Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Initialization Issue ✅
**Problem**: Bot service was calling `DatabaseManager.initialize()` synchronously, but it's an async function.
**Fix**: Changed to `await DatabaseManager.initialize()` in `packages/bot/src/index.ts`
**Impact**: This was causing the database connection to fail silently, leading to 503 errors.

### 2. Railway Service Configuration Issue ✅
**Problem**: Both client and bot services were configured to use the same URL (`https://ticketmesh.win`), causing the client to call itself instead of the bot service.
**Fix**: Updated `railway.toml` to use `${{ticketmesh-bot.RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` for `BOT_API_BASE_URL`
**Impact**: This ensures the client can properly communicate with the bot service.

### 3. Health Endpoint Logging ✅
**Problem**: Limited visibility into health check failures.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to both bot and client health checks:
- Bot service: Added detailed logging for database connection tests
- Client service: Added logging for bot service communication attempts
**Impact**: Better debugging and monitoring capabilities.

### 4. Error Handling Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult.
**Fix**: Enhanced error handling in:
- `packages/bot/src/server/http.ts`: More detailed error responses
- `packages/client/lib/database-health.ts`: Better error messages and logging
**Impact**: Easier troubleshooting when issues occur.

### 5. Timeout Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Short timeouts could cause false failures.
**Fix**: Increased timeout from 5s to 10s in database health checker.
**Impact**: More reliable health checks, especially under load.

## Files Modified

1. **`packages/bot/src/index.ts`**
   - Fixed async database initialization
   - Updated console message from "SQLite" to "PostgreSQL"

2. **`packages/bot/src/server/http.ts`**
   - Added detailed logging for health checks
   - Enhanced error responses with more details

3. **`packages/client/lib/database-health.ts`**
   - Added logging for bot service communication
   - Improved error handling and messages
   - Increased timeout for reliability

4. **`railway.toml`**
   - Fixed service URL configuration
   - Ensured proper inter-service communication

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the following endpoints should work correctly:

- ✅ `GET /health` (Bot service) - Should return 200 with comprehensive health data
- ✅ `GET /api/health` (Client service) - Should return 200 with basic health info
- ✅ `GET /api/health/database` (Client service) - Should return 200 when database is connected
- ✅ `GET /api/health/bot` (Client service) - Should return 200 with bot status
- ✅ `GET /api/status` (Client service) - Should return 200 with overall system status

## Testing

Use the provided `test-api-fixes.js` script to verify all endpoints are working:

```bash
node test-api-fixes.js
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Railway Environment Variables**: Ensure the following are set in Railway Dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (for both services)
   - `API_SECRET` (must match between services)
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` (bot service only)
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` (client service only)

2. **Service URLs**: After deployment, Railway will automatically set the `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` for the bot service, which the client will use to communicate with it.

3. **Health Check Paths**: Railway is configured to use:
   - Bot service: `/health`
   - Client service: `/api/health`

## Monitoring

The enhanced logging will help monitor:
- Database connection status and response times
- Bot service communication health
- Detailed error information for troubleshooting

All health endpoints now provide comprehensive status information that can be used for monitoring and alerting systems.
